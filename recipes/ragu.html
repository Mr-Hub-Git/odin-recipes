    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>No lasagna is complete without a perfect sauce. This <em>slow cooked</em> ragu is just what you are looking for!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 white onion diced</li>
            <li>2 celery stalks diced</li>
            <li>2 Carrots peeled and diced</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Sea salt</li>
            <li>¾ cup fresh or frozen peas</li>
            <li>1 fresh sweet Italian sausage link</li>
            <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
            <li>1 cup diced mushrooms I like shitake</li>
            <li>¾ cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped parsley</li>
            <li>1 14.5-ounce can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
            <li>½ cup freshly and finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the onions, celery and carrots in olive oil in a large pan over a medium-low flame.</li>
            <li>Once the beef begins to release its juices, add the wine and simmer until the alcohol aroma dissipates and the liquid is reduced by about ⅓, about a minute. Season the beef with a flurry of parsley, then add the tomatoes, pressing them into the meat with the back of a wooden spoon or with a potato masher until they are incorporated with the meat sauce. Turn the flame down to low and simmer, covered, for 1 ½ hours.</li>
        </ol>
